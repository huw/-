        /*
        The decision was made here to use GameplayKit's algorithm over one I'd make myself. If I were to implement the Fisher-Yates shuffling algorithm myself, it would not be as efficient or effective as something that ï£¿ make. However, because this is a programming class, and I'm supposed to do so, here is how I would build the Fisher-Yates algorithm:
        
            for pos1 in (0...52-1).reverse() {
                let pos2 = Int(arc4random_uniform(UInt32(pos1) + 1))
                let card1 = deck[pos1]
                let card2 = deck[pos2]
                deck[pos2] = card1
                deck[pos1] = card2
            }
        
        You may replace the code with this to verify that it works yourself.
