        The decision was made here to use GameplayKit's algorithm over one I'd make myself. If I were to implement the Fisher-Yates shuffling algorithm myself, it would not be as efficient or effective as something that ï£¿ make. However, because this is a programming class, and I'm supposed to do so, here is how I would build the Fisher-Yates algorithm:
        
            for pos1 in (0...52-1).reverse() {
                let pos2 = Int(arc4random_uniform(UInt32(pos1) + 1))
                let card1 = deck[pos1]
                let card2 = deck[pos2]
                deck[pos2] = card1
                deck[pos1] = card2
            }
        
        You may replace the code with this to verify that it works yourself.

        /*
        How this works:
        
        The player is the 'base node' here. It subclasses SKNode, which means it has a position and inherits some of those basic properties, but it doesn't need to display so we don't give it anything like SKSpriteNode etc.
        
        What we _do_ get, is that all things attached to it are positioned relatively to it all. The base position of the player is where the points label sits. Most of the rest of the positioning is in the Player() class anyway.
        
        This way, when we deal cards we can place them relatively around the screen.
