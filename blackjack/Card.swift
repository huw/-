So for the displaying of the cards, I've not only opted to use the set contained within Unicode, but I also don't think I should have to have a huge dictionary or `switch` to store all of them. There's a better wayâ€”every Unicode character (as it should) has a number assigned to it, in hexadecimal. Using some pretty easy math, we can print out the appropriate Unicode character by calling some functions within out enums.
        Here, we start with the character 0x1F0A0, which is an empty card back. When the suit and rank are specified, we can add their scalars to 0x1F0A0 and now we have the cards we want. For reference, I'm using the table at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_cards_in_Unicode#Block
